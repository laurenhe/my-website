{"author": 2, "title": "Torres del Paine", "slug": "torres-del-paine", "content": "<p>My first backpacking experience will be on the Circuit Trek of the Torres del Paine National Park in Southern Chile. I have been planning this trip since the spring of 2017 and it is finally happening! If you count the time I spent daydreaming about traveling to Patagonia, the planning period actually trails back into 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not remember how exactly this particular destination landed on the top of my list. It could be that I chanced upon entrancing photos (with ease I imagine considering the ever-growing popularity of this region among travelers) that filled me with such great longing and imaginings. Compound that with the latent wanderlust stirring within me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel is wonderfully purposeful. We travel to discover far and distant places for ourselves. We travel to find inspiration. We travel to learn. As I weave the narrative of my life, travel will be a warp thread. So here I am as I start on my journey to write about my expeditions to the far and distant lands I will travel to. This repository is itself a monument of learning being built from the ground up. And it is where I will document my journey, my struggles, my learnings, my na&iuml;vet&eacute;, my joys, my inhibitions, my revelations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resistances at play were apparent from the beginning. Planning was the monolith in the way of my goals. I knew I had research to do and lots of it. I eventually narrowed my focus further. Patagonia covers a vast swath of land in both Chile and Argentina. It seems common to take a whole month or more to try to explore the extent of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with the daunting task of creating an itinerary, I decided to take it slow and place all my attention on one park. After some preliminary research, the real in-depth research commenced. I found that the more research I did the more excited I was to make this trip happen and to do further research. Being a complete beginner to backpacking and camping (and really having never done either), I knew I was going to need someone to more or less hold my hand on my first venture out into the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web searches led me quickly to a number of tour options for both the W and the Circuit trek. Reading blogs and travel sites made my final decision on the Circuit rather simple. I wanted to experience as much of the park as I can and wouldn&#39;t be under any time constraints to go elsewhere. Guided tours can get very expensive so deciding on the one I happened across that came with a considerably reasonable price tag did not take too much thought either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is decidedly less expensive to travel through the park without a guide but with my complete lack of experience having a guide was nothing short of necessary. There&#39;s also a great deal of convenience if you go with a tour operator. Food, transportation (excluding to and from the airport), and camping gear are provided. They also take care of making reservations for the campsites which I read can be a pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the same time that I was comparison shopping tour programs, I was also browsing and even ordering gear that I knew I was eventually going to need. My backpacking pack was one of the first things I ordered. The biggest hurdle in my way was actually booking flights. Plane tickets to Chile from San Francisco are steeply priced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My inclination to make Patagonia the first destination to start off what I hope will be a lifetime of traveling was driven by the false notion that flying to South America would be relatively cheaper than flying elsewhere. During the summer months, roundtrip tickets reach over 2K. This was the primary reason I moved the trip from the holiday season of late December/early January to late March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There came a point where I was just so sick of getting alerts and thinking about booking flights that I just went for it. Once I finally bought roundtrip tickets through an app, the barriers started to crumble further and quicker. With the internet these days, booking transportation and lodging can easily be done online. I read through reams of reviews on TripAdvisor for restaurants and hostels. I downloaded WhatsApp to communicate with the program manager and my parents if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I developed a friendly rapport with the program manager through a long email correspondence that spanned over several months. I had a lot of time to think of questions and they came up often. I was fortunate that my contact was very patient with me and answered the countless emails and questions I sent him. When it came to planning this trip, the reassurance from our email communication put me at ease and I was well on my way to gathering all of the necessary gear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my gear I was able to select and purchase with ease. I was completely flustered when it came to the hiking boots. I made several trips to REI and once to Sports Basement to try on boots. Some brands I found out are well-suited for backpacking while others are less supportive or made to be attractive but not so functional. I learned that it is important to test the boots on the mounds or ramps by stomping downward to see if your toes hit the front of the boot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found frustratingly that if you will it you can still touch the tip of the boot no matter how well the boot might fit in other ways. Later on, I found that you can still control the force when stepping down on a steep incline even while carrying a heavy pack. Boots come in different widths for different feet structure. Mine is narrow and there didn&#39;t seem to be many options for narrow width boots which actually made it easier to zero in on a style from a particular brand that did make narrow width boots. After seeing a different style of the same brand on sale and half off, I finally got boots for Christmas (thanks mom!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My struggle with the boots were far from over. The laces on my right boot especially likes to let loose. Sometimes they magically come completely undone. There seems to be little worse than having loose laces and boots that are not snuggly secured around your feet and ankles. I have looked down many times at my feet with chagrin to see the matrix of laces unraveling. My lack of luck in this department has made having snug and secure boots one of the best feelings. If only they would stay that way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I reached a certain point where I realized I was settling into the paralyzing comfort of this phase of my trip planning. I was conducting research and not much else. The thing I was putting off was the thing that I feared the most and is a critical part of getting ready for the trek. I was going to have to get into tip-top shape. I was going to have to carry a previously unimaginable amount of weight. I was going to have to become comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A resounding message I&#39;ve been hearing a lot this year happens to be that you need to confront and embrace your fears. Chase after them in the same way you chase after dreams. The Swiss dramatist Friedrich Durrenmatt said to learn to conquer your fears as that is the only art we have to learn to master these days. The poet William Stafford said that what you fear will not go away; it will take you into yourself and bless you and keep you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I doubted my ability to carry all the weight that I would need to while trekking long distances. I weigh about 115lbs and the maximum weight I was told I will be carrying is roughly 18 kilos or 39lbs. That&#39;s 34% my body weight. While I had kept up with cardio in the previous months, I was putting the necessary work off. I was scared to add weight to my pack but I knew I needed to get out there and train. Mind over matter. Chasing aesthetic rapture and chasing fear had become one in the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My initiation into training was an urban hike that took 6 hours and left me somewhat devastated. Two months before my trip I headed out with my pack that was no where near capacity in weight and experienced something grueling mentally and physically. It was agony almost all the way through. The fact that I was a complete beginner was excruciatingly apparent. I did not even use the waist straps on my pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pain in my right shoulder and the area right above my left ankle was especially bad. My feet were aching through and through. I had painful blisters on both heels which made it hard to walk. Instead of feeling powerful and accomplished, I felt defeated in the end. I knew I needed to continue training and not be hindered by one traumatic experience. The next day my feet were still recovering. My legs were sore and I experienced bursts of stinging pain in my right shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One week later I put about 9 pounds worth of bottled water in my pack. The weight was very noticeable. I was wobbling a bit. Fixing the waist strap to fit my waist helped. I noticed that going downhill was harder on my shoulder than going uphill. This last hour was incredibly painful and tiring. The load did feel more distributed across my shoulders. And I didn&#39;t develop blisters on the bottom of my heels this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My pack got so heavy at one point that I could no longer lift it by the loop and have to sit on the ground to get it on. Having the pack on is somewhat of a visual gag. It&#39;s a big backpack on a small person of average height. Training is by no means glamorous. I listened to a lot of Spotify to keep me going. I kept waiting for it to crush my resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the last weekend of January and my pack was up to 12 more pounds. I was scared. My trapezius muscle on both sides still felt numb at times. The moments of low discomfort were fleeting. I had to retie my right boot multiples times. But I found those times bending over to be a reprieve because some weight was eased off my shoulder. Listening to the right kind of music definitely helped. Sometimes I would wiggle my shoulders along with a song that got me going. I liked paying attention to all these nuances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My hands were a good assist. It was more tiring to just have them drop down next to my legs. I felt like my arms had a better range of motion this time. Reaching behind my head to tighten my ponytail was not as straining as last time. There were times where I felt rather light like going down the steps to capture a couple of shots of the man with the same baby carriage backpack I saw on the bus last weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later I added 17 pounds to my pack. I thought that it will be more mentally draining not to train. Training was starting to feel empowering rather than disheartening. I pictured ancestors carrying children on their backs while working in the fields. I was still having trouble with my right boot. The laces kept on coming loose. I noticed that if I tie above the middle eyelet the laces seem to stay tight. Music was my safety blanket. I decided that I was going to train every other day from then until my trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day after I was up to 20 pounds extra. I stayed on the massive hills near where I live and sweated a lot. Listening to the right song while going up these massive hills is motivating. There was a welt on my right shoulder. Nike was on to something with the slogan just do it. The first weekend of February I went out on a hot and sunny day. I readjusted the shoulder straps on my pack using the adjustable Velcro and tightened the waist straps even more to the point that they were slightly uncomfortable which seemed to help. Walking in certain ways also helped redistribute the weight onto my hips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going up a famous set of steps was the hardest part of my training today. My chest was hurting after (maybe because my heart is working so hard) and I was for gasping for breath. Even just standing didn&#39;t help much. I was probably dehydrated. I couldn&#39;t make it to the highest natural point in SF and stopped at nearby park. It was annoying having to hold onto my phone to keep it from swinging in my jacket pocket which was tied around my waist. But it was too hot to add another layer. My left shoulder and back felt more uncomfortable this time. Back at the apartment, my body felt so weak once I took the pack off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple days later I added three more water bottles to my pack along with my running shoes. I&#39;m having trouble with overfilling the pack now. I&#39;ve reached and exceed the volume capacity with all those water bottles and actual hiking gear stuffed in there. I cannot tilt my head back to stretch my neck. That weekend the wind was intense. It was like walking against a wall while hiking up the hill next to the ocean. And I kept getting blown to one side. I felt radiating pain from my shoulders going down my back after about two hours of walking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training that third weekend of February was brutal. The wind and sand lashing at my face, the bitter cold freezing my hands and making my rose run uncontrollably, not being able to see where I was stepping, and my boots coming loose over and over again numbed me considerably. The wind was around 25mph. My entire head was just numb. To close off February I ended up walking for about 4 hours and 30 minutes that weekend. I developed an irritating pressure point on the top of my foot right on the tendon. It was swollen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many people, I took Spanish in high school. I primarily used Mango for travel Spanish and took a break from German as learning two languages at once can be tricky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\"
